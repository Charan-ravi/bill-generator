# bill-generator
This is a Java application which is shows the implementation of a discount calculator for a supermarket promotion, 

based on the requirements provided from the sample input and problem statement.

The code includes classes to represent items, apply discounts, and generate receipts. 

I've included unit tests to verify the functionality.

As expected this application reads items from the console, 

calculates the discounted prices based on the specified rules, 

and prints a formatted receipt. 

The unit tests ensure that the discount calculations are accurate. 

You can run this code in any Java environment that supports JDK 8 or higher(please switch to master branch).
